REGEX mean REGular EXpression which in turn is nothing but sequence of characters.

These expressions say for example [0â€“9] means that the expression should contain numbers.

Regular expressions are used in many situation in computer programming.

Majorly in search, pattern matching, parsing, filtering of results and so on.

In lay man words, its a kind of rule which programmer tells to the computer to understand.

You may see this in website forms, where you are only forced to enter ONLY numbers or ONLY characters or MINIMUM 8 characters and so on, these are controlled by REGEX behind the screen.

To achieve this, many programming languages have their own way of implementation.

Regular expression is a pattern that matches against text. Let's simplify it word by word. To understand regular expression, we need to understand what is pattern. When you find things happening in an order repeatedly, that is a pattern. For example, every 3rd glass in a row of 100 glasses is of blue color, so that's a pattern of blue glass being followed till the count of glass reaches its limit. One example, that we have always ignored but we learnt it subconsciously is LINE. Line is made up of words with spaces between them and ending with some punctuation, so there is a pattern in it. There are a lot of such examples like URL, Phone numbers, working hours of an employee in a company and many more. So, if we are able to find a pattern out of some given text, then we can develop an expression to extract the data that matched out of whole text and that expression we call Regular Expression.
