Application of Convolutional Neural Networks in the Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori Infection Based on Endoscopic Images
Background and aims

The role of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori gastritis based on endoscopic images has not been evaluated. We constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN), and evaluated its ability to diagnose H. pylori infection.
Methods

A 22-layer, deep CNN was pre-trained and fine-tuned on a dataset of 32,208 images either positive or negative for H. pylori (first CNN). Another CNN was trained using images classified according to 8 anatomical locations (secondary CNN). A separate test data set (11,481 images from 397 patients) was evaluated by the CNN, and 23 endoscopists, independently.
Results

The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and diagnostic time were 81.9%, 83.4%, 83.1%, and 198 s, respectively, for the first CNN, and 88.9%, 87.4%, 87.7%, and 194 s, respectively, for the secondary CNN. These values for the 23 endoscopists were 79.0%, 83.2%, 82.4%, and 230 ± 65 min (85.2%, 89.3%, 88.6%, and 253 ± 92 min by 6 board-certified endoscopists), respectively. The secondary CNN had a significantly higher accuracy than endoscopists (by 5.3%; 95% CI, 0.3–10.2).
Conclusion

H. pylori gastritis could be diagnosed based on endoscopic images using CNN with higher accuracy and in a considerably shorter time compared to manual diagnosis by endoscopists.
